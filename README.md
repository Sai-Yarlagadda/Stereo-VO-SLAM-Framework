## Abstract

The main purpose of this project is to understand the engineering intricacies of building a SLAM system. . There are a lot of SLAM implementations, the absence of uniformity often complicates selection for further development. To surmount this, a simplistic yet comprehensive stereo Visual Odometry SLAM system is built and evaluated on the KITTI odometry dataset, specifically sequence 00. A comprehensive
description of the theory behind the numerous components of
our system such as frontend, backend, and loop closure, has
been given. The results of our system are qualitative for now.
Limitations have been identified in our system, and a discussion
on how to improve it further is done.
